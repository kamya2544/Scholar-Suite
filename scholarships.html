    <h2><b><center>Top Scholarships for Indian Students</center></b></h2>
    <p><i>To make education as affordable as possible for students, especially low-income students, the government and other organizations provide scholarships for school and university education. The cost of education is always increasing, which means that academically meritorious students from low-income families are forced to drop out of school and college. Some of these students give up on their dreams of pursuing higher education, even though they are academically talented.

        According to research, only about 70 percent of all students complete school in India, and graduation from colleges and universities has a similar dropout pattern. Luckily, there are different scholarships out there for deserving students:
